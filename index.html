      PUBLIC DREAM is a project by
      <a href="https://adamrgarcia.studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="body-link">Adam R Garcia</a>.
      All information and imagery pulled from Wikipedia, which means it's probably not all correct, but a good place to think
      about how we create myths through time, and how they create us in return. "Myth is the public dream and dream is the private myth." —Joseph Campbell
